# Building NeoWidEx

The original NeoWidEx author's unimpressive build workflow is as follows:

1. Load `NeoWidEx.X68` in the [EASy68K](http://www.easy68k.com/) editor.

2. Assemble (Project â†’ Assemble Source...).

3. Use the `srec_cat` utility (distributed as part of the [SRecord package](
   http://srecord.sourceforge.net/)) to convert the `NeoWidEx.S68` file
   generated by the assembler into a raw binary file prepared for loading into
   memory at address `$800`. The command line:

   `srec_cat NeoWidEx.S68 -offset -0x800 -o NeoWidEx.bin -binary`

   The utility may warn that two different values have been specified for the
   same memory address. If this occurs, it's probably necessary to edit the
   section base addresses at the top of `NeoWidEx.X68` to give additional room
   to whatever item has outgrown its space allocation (probably the code).
   Warnings about data records not being in strictly ascending order may be
   safely ignored.

4. Use the `dc42_build_bootable_disk.py` script distributed with the
   ["Stepleton" bootloader](https://github.com/stpltn/bootloader), along with
   the bootloader binary itself, to create a bootable .dc42 floppy disk image
   file.

Other workflows may be just as good, or probably better.
