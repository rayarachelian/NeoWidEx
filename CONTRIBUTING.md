# Contributing to NeoWidEx

First, thanks for your interest!

As of April 2017, the author of the original NeoWidEx implementation has worked
too long on NeoWidEx and is excited to do other things in his spare time.
Managing a public domain software project for a very old computer is not
necessarily one of these things.

As NeoWidEx is public domain software (see the [LICENSE](LICENSE)), anyone is
free to create and administer their own fork if they like. It would be
perfectly fine if some other NeoWidEx repository became recognised as the
"authoritative" distribution one day. This said, a pull request against the
"original" NeoWidEx MASTER will be considered under the following conditions:

1. The contribution is explicitly released into the public domain. Refer to
   the documentation at http://unlicense.org/, subsection "Unlicensing
   Contributions" for suggestions on how to do this. It's your responsibility
   to make sure that your employer---or anyone in the world, ultimately,
   including yourself---can express no claim on the code you contribute.

2. The contribution adheres scrupulously to the original author's undocumented
   (albeit fairly consistent) style preferences, including commenting nearly
   all instructions with a short statement featuring no ending punctuation.

NeoWidEx is a tidy garden kept by a naive and inexperienced gardener. These
rules are stipulated with his ease and comfort as their chief priority :smile:.
