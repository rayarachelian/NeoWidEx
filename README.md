# NeoWidEx

NeoWidEx is a formatting and diagnostic utility for tbe Widget, a 10-megabyte hard drive that Apple Computer designed and
manufactured the 1980s. It runs on the Apple Lisa 2/10 computer, the only computer Apple ever sold with a Widget inside.

## Fair warning

NeoWidEx can easily permanently destroy all of the data on your Widget. It might even destroy your Widget itself, or perhaps your entire Lisa, even if it is used in a cautious and sensible way.

## Required reading

NeoWidEx is a powerful tool that issues low-level commands directly to a Widget. To use NeoWidEx effectively, you need to know
how a Widget works and what these commands do.

This document will not give you this knowledge on its own. Get ready to use NeoWidEx by studying the [Widget ERS document](
