# NeoWidEx

NeoWidEx is a formatting and diagnostic utility for the Widget, a 10-megabyte
hard drive that Apple Computer designed and manufactured the 1980s. It runs on
the Apple Lisa 2/10 computer, the only computer Apple ever sold with a Widget
inside.

## Fair warning

NeoWidEx can easily destroy all of the data on your Widget, quickly and
permanently. It might even harm your Widget itself, even if it is used in a
cautious and sensible way. If you're not prepared to risk these consequences,
don't use NeoWidEx.

## Required reading

NeoWidEx is a powerful tool that issues low-level commands directly to a
Widget. To use NeoWidEx effectively, you need to know how a Widget works and
what these commands do.

The documentation that comes with NeoWidEx will not give you this knowledge on
its own. Get ready to use NeoWidEx by studying the [Widget ERS document](
http://bitsavers.trailing-edge.com/pdf/apple/disk/widget/Widget_ERS.pdf).

## System requirements

You can get started right away with NeoWidEx if you have:

- A working floppy drive (or a floppy drive emulator like [Floppy Emu](
  http://www.bigmessowires.com/floppy-emu/)).
- A Lisa 2 with ROM version H.

If you're missing any of these things but wish to use NeoWidEx anyway, refer to
the "System requirements" section in MANUAL.md.

The [LisaEm](http://lisa.sunder.net) emulator will run NeoWidEx, although
because LisaEm does not emulate a Widget, many options will be unavailable.
